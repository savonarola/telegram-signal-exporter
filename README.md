## Prerequisites

- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- [`signal-cli`](https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli)
- [`qrencode`](https://github.com/fukuchi/libqrencode)

## Usage

### Link `signal-cli` to your Signal account

Run
```bash
signal-cli link -n "MacBook Air"
```

It will print a `sgnl://...` link.

**Without** stoping the process, in a separate shell run

```bash
qrencode -t utf8 "sgnl://..."
```

with the link printed above.

Link the client with this QR using the phone's app.

After linking on the phone, the `signal-cli link` process will continue and link the client to the account.

To verify that the link was successful, run

```bash
signal-cli listAccounts
```
